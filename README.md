# DoomMake Example WAD

by MTrop (C) 2021

## What This Is

This is an example DoomMake project to show people how cool this stuff is.


## First Steps

Create a file called `doommake.properties` and throw this stuff in there:

	doommake.iwad=H:/Doom/iwads/DOOM2.WAD
	doommake.run.exe=H:/DoomDev/Exes/ChocoDoom/chocolate-doom.exe
	doommake.run.switch.file=-merge

You'll probably have to change those paths to the pertinent files. Note that `.properties` 
files use backslashes differently (see the [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties). 
The first property is for the IWAD to use as a base for texture merging (`DOOM2.WAD`), 
and the other is for locating Chocolate Doom to test (if you don't use Chocolate Doom, 
remove the last line).

This file is ignored in your repository.


## Generated by the Project

	/build               Build directory.
	/dist                Distributables directory.
